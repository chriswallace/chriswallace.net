<p>Born and raised in St. Louis, MO, I was diagnosed at 19 with testicular cancer. I was forced to drop out of college and endure aggressive chemotherapy, all while expecting my first child with my girlfriend of five years. Faced with these hardships at such a young age, I joined the workforce, not just to survive, but to provide for my growing family. Those first few years were difficult but critical in teaching me vital skills as a young designer and technologist.</p>

<p>In 2009, I co-founded Lift UX, a design agency that transcended traditional boundaries. We earned multiple Emmy nominations for our innovative apps for TV shows like The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, and Mad Men. In 2017, the agency was acquired by 10up, a leading WordPress digital agency. There, I led an international team, gaining invaluable experiences while working with companies like Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, as well as with organizations such as The Boston Globe and the California DMV.</p>

<p>Desiring a new challenge, I left my corporate role in 2021 to venture into the exciting world of web3, founding UltraDAO. This decentralized art collective has been at the forefront of integrating blockchain technology into the creative sector. Our project, Woodies, rapidly gained traction, bringing in millions in revenue in just a few months.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, my team and I have released transformative digital, blockchain-powered art experiences like the Twelve Days of CryptoArt, Legends of Wondermist, a short film titled Woodies: Origin, and the upcoming Woodies NEMESIS project. Each project serves as a step toward a future where art and technology not only co-exist but thrive together, telling stories that engage and inspire.</p>
