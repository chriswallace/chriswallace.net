            <p class="sub-heading fade-in-element">Hey there! I'm a design leader with a passion for code who loves creating digital products that make people smile. When I'm not geeking out over pixels and prototypes, I'm dreaming up ways to use tech to bring people together and make the world a bit more awesome.</p>
            <hr class="fade-in-element -mt-4">
            <p class="fade-in-element">I thrive on building things from scratch, especially startups. My approach is simple: put people first, work together, and move fast while staying flexible. This mindset has helped me guide several companies to successful exits and major milestones over the years.</p>
            <p class="fade-in-element">One of my proudest achievements was leading an agency team that earned Emmy nominations for our work on AMC shows like Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead. When <a href="https://10up.com">10up</a> acquired us, I built and led a design team of 20 talented folks, partnering with amazing clients like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and even The Nobel Prize.</p>
            <p class="fade-in-element">So the question now is, what am I looking for? I’m seeking a role at a company with a clear and important mission, a team that understands the value a great design leader brings, working on a product that is poised to change the game—with just a teeeeny bit of help from me.</p>
