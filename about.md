        <h1 class="fade-in-element">Hi, I'm Chris.</h1>
        <p class="sub-heading fade-in-element" data-scramble>I'm a senior product design leader who believes the best products come from the best teams. For over twenty years, I've focused on building design organizations where talented people can do their best workâ€”mentoring designers, connecting great people, and maintaining a high bar for craft.</p>
        <hr class="hr-separator fade-in-element">
        <p class="fade-in-element" data-scramble>At 10up, I grew our design team from 8 to 25 people, creating processes and culture that enabled us to deliver exceptional work for clients like Microsoft, Google, and the California DMV. The real success wasn't just the projectsâ€”it was watching designers grow, take on leadership roles, and push each other to new levels of craft.</p>
        <p class="fade-in-element" data-scramble>When I founded UltraDAO Studios, I built a creative team from scratch that generated $2.6M in six months while maintaining uncompromising quality standards. But what I'm most proud of is the collaborative environment we createdâ€”one where every team member felt empowered to contribute their best ideas.</p>
        <p class="fade-in-element" data-scramble>At Roblox, I work with the Avatars team to remove friction from the creator experience, but I'm equally focused on how we work together as a team. Great products emerge from great collaboration, and great collaboration happens when people feel supported to take risks and push boundaries.</p>
        <p class="fade-in-element" data-scramble>I'm looking for my next opportunity to lead a product design team where mentorship is valued, craft is non-negotiable, and building great designers is just as important as building great products. If you're building a design organization that values growth, connection, and exceptional work, I'd love to talk.</p>
