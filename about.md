        <p class="sub-heading fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-2" data-scramble>For over twenty years, companies have turned to me when they need to transform complex technical challenges into experiences people actually want to use. This work has helped startups achieve exits worth tens of millions, entertainment companies win awards for their digital platforms, and creators tell stories through <a href="/portfolio/woodies">new mediums</a>.</p>
        <hr class="hr-separator fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-3">
        <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-4" data-scramble>Organizations like AMC Networks, The Nobel Prize, MLB, and DC Comics have each faced unique digital challengesâ€”from engaging audiences across platforms to making complex information accessible. When one startup needed to reach millions in revenue quickly, the solution wasn't just good design, but understanding what users genuinely needed.</p>
        <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-4" data-scramble>Leading a twenty-four person design team meant solving problems at scale. The California DMV needed to modernize citizen services. Starbucks, Microsoft, and Google each had different platform challenges. The Walking Dead and Mad Men required sophisticated entertainment experiences that felt effortless to viewersâ€”work that helped the agency achieve a successful exit.</p>
        <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-4" data-scramble>At Roblox, millions of creators need better tools to bring their ideas to life. The Avatars team focuses on removing technical friction from avatar creation in Roblox Studio, so creators spend time on imagination rather than troubleshooting.</p>
        <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-4" data-scramble>The most interesting problems are often the ones that seem impossible to solveâ€”new products with no precedent, experimental interfaces, teams ready to push into uncharted territory. Companies facing these challenges need someone who can see a path forward.</p>
