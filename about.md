        <h1 class="fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-1">Hi, I'm Chris.</h1>
        <p class="sub-heading fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-2" data-scramble>At my core, I love making complex things feel simple and delightful. For over two decades, I've been fascinated by the intersection of design and technologyâ€”using that curiosity to push boundaries and create magical digital experiences. This drive led me to successfully exit multiple startups for tens of millions of dollars, pioneer award-winning social TV apps, and even create an <a href="/portfolio/woodies">acclaimed animated short film</a>.</p>
        <hr class="hr-separator fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-3">
        <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-4" data-scramble>My journey has been about transforming complicated challenges into elegant solutions and brand-building experiences. Working with companies like AMC Networks, The Nobel Prize, MLB, and DC Comics, I've consistently found ways to do exactly that. When I bootstrapped my latest startup to millions in revenue within six months, it wasn't just about the numbersâ€”it was about creating products that genuinely resonated with people.</p>
        <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-4" data-scramble>As my career evolved into agency leadership, I built a remote design team of two dozen global talents inside a company of 200+. Together, we tackled complex projects for the California DMV, Starbucks, Microsoft, and Googleâ€”always focusing on turning intricate requirements into intuitive experiences. Our work on Emmy-nominated apps for The Walking Dead and Mad Men proved that even the most sophisticated entertainment platforms could feel effortless to users, and was instrumental in achieving a successful exit for my small UX-centered agency.</p>
        <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-4" data-scramble>Currently at Roblox, I'm designing creator tools for the Avatars team, focusing on streamlining avatar auto-setup processes in Roblox Studio. By incorporating AI into my workflow, I'm pioneering new approaches to solve complex design challenges and enhance creator experiences.</p>
        <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-up-delay-4" data-scramble>Throughout my career, I've found that the most rewarding moments come from taking on ambitious challenges and turning them into reality. I love building net new products, prototyping immersive experiences, and growing design capabilities within teams excited to innovate together. As of today, I am currently looking for a full-time, salaried role where I can do exactly that.</p>
