            <p class="sub-heading fade-in-element">Growing up in St. Louis, MO, I was unexpectedly thrust into adulthood at 19 with a cancer diagnosis, a child on the way, and the need to create a future from scratch. Those early challenges shaped my approach to design: bold, human-centered, and uncompromising in quality.</p>
            <hr class="fade-in-element -mt-4">
            <p class="fade-in-element">In 2009, I co-founded Lift UX, a digital design agency with a knack for immersive, award-winning web experiences. Our work gained traction in media circles, including Emmy nominations for groundbreaking second-screen experiences with AMC’s hit shows like Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead. We also created UpThemes, Designmoo, and 365psd, connecting the design community with resources that inspired a new generation of creators.</p>
            <p class="fade-in-element">After our acquisition by 10up in 2017, I led global teams, driving digital transformations for giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and even The White House. Among these, redesigning the California DMV's website became a particularly rewarding milestone—improving the online experience for millions of residents while redefining what public sector digital design could be.</p>
            <p class="fade-in-element">By 2021, I was drawn to the emerging potential of web3, founding <a href="https://ultradao.org" target="_blank">UltraDAO</a>, a decentralized creative studio with a mission to blend art, technology, and purpose. Our first project, Woodies, became a milestone in environmental impact, funding the planting of one million trees and earning industry recognition as the <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1539427235719008257" target="_blank">Best Environmental Initiative in NFT</a>. As we continue to build, projects like Woodies: Origin—a Web3 animated short—showcase our commitment to storytelling that challenges and excites.</p>
            <p class="fade-in-element">Beyond UltraDAO, I’ve also curated unique blockchain-powered art collections like <a href="https://twelvedays.ultradao.org/" target="_blank">Twelve Days of CryptoArt</a> and <a href="https://ultradao.org/curated" target="_blank">UltraDAO Curated</a>, exploring how tech can elevate the art world. My journey has been about more than just creating products—it's about building experiences that connect us, reflect our humanity, and make waves in new and powerful ways.</p>
