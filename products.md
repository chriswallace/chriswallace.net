Below are some of the ongoing projects I've been working on over the past couple years that I maintain.

- [Twelve Days of CryptoArt](https://twelvedays.ultradao.org) - I curate, design, and develop the app for this fun art collecting event. It involves a blind art reveal where collectors can choose their favorite piece to own, later learning who the artist behind the piece is.

- [Woodies](https://woodiesofficial.com) - I am the project lead for Woodies, a web3 entertainment brand and NFT collection with over 4,000 collectors. With 3D models, tremendous lore, and commercial licensing/ownership for each character, offering one of the most interesting and value-driven brands in web3. Plus we've donated over $250,000 to plant one million trees.
