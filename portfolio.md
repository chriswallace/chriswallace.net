        <p>Year: 2024</p>
        <p>One of the key features users request most frequently on Candy.com is the ability to withdraw their NFT-powered digital collectibles to a private, self-custodied wallet. I created a multi-select UX pattern to select assets, added an example of one of the many wallet connection flows, and implemented some progress indicators to show when a deposit has processed successfully.</p>

        <p>Wallace Museum is a new online art gallery dedicated to showcasing generative art in a new and unique format.

        <p>Legends of Wondermist is a set of digital collectible cards with four different levels of rarity: common, uncommon, rare, and legendary. I worked with a small team of artists and developers to produce artwork, design cards for each rarity, and craft a mint experience that is both fun and visually exciting. I designed the logo, website, and card templates myself. Artists for the series include Mike Shinoda (of Linkin Park), DesLucrece, Victoria Lopez, Waxbones, Luna Leonis, and Amrit Pal Singh.</p>

        <p>In partnership with Google, we launched a WordPress plugin that integrates Google's suite of products in one location. Site Kit quickly gained adoption among website owners, thanks to a design language that strikingly represented both Google's identity and the WordPress admin environment. I worked with a Lead Designer in a Creative Director role to deliver product design that perfectly integrated the design language of Google into the WordPress dashboard.</p>

        <p>As the Creative Director, I helped lead the design of the "Mad Men: The Fan Cut" web application celebrating AMC's flagship series. This involved creating a marketing mini-site with a custom video user submission app. We built a WordPress-powered app for fans to claim and recreate short clips from the series, uploaded to YouTube and submitted for editorial review. The app featured a modern design that respected the 1960s and 70s aesthetic of "Mad Men," with elements like parallax scrolling and the iconic logo and silhouette.</p>
