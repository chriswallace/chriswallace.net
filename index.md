<p class="fade-in-element">Over the past two years, I've been working with artists, blockchain developers, and creative producers to develop digital assets and collectibles in the web3 space. This brand new, nascent industry has been a sandbox for the future of every design-related field: 3D, the Web, apps, games, and more.</p>

<p class="fade-in-element">My goal is to develop ethical, practical, and time-saving tools to revolutionize design in a post-AI world while maintaining the footprints of humanity in everything we create.</p>
