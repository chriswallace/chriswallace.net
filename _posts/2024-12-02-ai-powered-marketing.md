    <p>In a world where every other app boasts “AI-powered” features, the question arises: do you really need to market your product that way? The short answer is… probably not. Here’s why.</p>

    <p>Let’s take a step back. Remember when SaaS (Software as a Service) was the hot new thing? At first, companies shouted “SaaS” from the rooftops. But now, no one really markets a product as a “SaaS app.” Instead, you highlight what SaaS enables: always-on accessibility, frequent updates, and continual innovation. The emphasis shifted from the underlying technology to the value it delivers.</p>

    <p>The same shift is happening with AI. While it’s tempting to plaster “AI-powered” across your marketing materials, the reality is that customers don’t care about the label—they care about the results. What does the AI actually do for them? Does it make their experience faster, smarter, or more personalized? Does it save them time, reduce effort, or deliver insights they couldn’t get otherwise?</p>

    <h2 id="focus-on-benefits" class="pt-6">Focus on Benefits, Not Buzzwords</h2>

    <p>Saying “AI-powered” is like saying “machine-made.” It might sound impressive at first, but it doesn’t tell the customer what’s in it for them. Instead of emphasizing the technology, shift your focus to the tangible benefits it provides. For example:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li>Does your AI streamline workflows so users can accomplish tasks in half the time?</li>
      <li>Does it offer hyper-personalized recommendations that make users feel seen and understood?</li>
      <li>Does it detect patterns, anomalies, or opportunities that would otherwise go unnoticed?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are the outcomes that resonate with users, not the fact that an algorithm is crunching data in the background.</p>

    <h2 id="show-dont-tell" class="pt-6">Show, Don’t Tell</h2>

    <p>If your product genuinely leverages AI in a meaningful way, you shouldn’t need to scream it from the rooftops. Instead, let the experience speak for itself. Build features that are so intuitive, smart, or efficient that users naturally recognize something special is happening. The best AI is often invisible—it just works.</p>

    <p>Think about the products you love. Do you use Google Search because it’s AI-powered? No, you use it because it delivers the most relevant results in milliseconds. Do you use Spotify because of its machine learning? No, you use it because Discover Weekly feels like it knows you.</p>

    <p>Highlighting the outcomes—faster results, better insights, personalized experiences—makes your messaging resonate far more than generic claims about AI.</p>

    <h2 id="avoid-commoditization" class="pt-6">Avoid the Commoditization Trap</h2>

    <p>When everyone is saying the same thing, it loses meaning. The term “AI-powered” has become so ubiquitous that it’s at risk of becoming white noise. By continuing to lead with it, you might inadvertently lump yourself in with a sea of indistinguishable competitors. Differentiation doesn’t come from the technology itself but from how well it’s applied to solve your users’ problems.</p>

    <p>Consider the story of Grammarly, a digital writing assistant that initially focused its marketing on the AI technology behind its grammar and spell-checking capabilities. However, Grammarly soon realized that users were more interested in the benefits they experienced, such as improved writing clarity, tone adjustments, and enhanced productivity. By shifting their focus to these user-centric benefits and sharing success stories and testimonials, Grammarly effectively communicated the value of their product without overemphasizing the AI component.</p>

    <h2 id="when-to-mention-ai" class="pt-6">When to Mention AI</h2>

    <p>Of course, there’s still a time and place to talk about AI. For example:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Enterprise Sales</dt>
      <dd>Larger organizations often care about the tech under the hood. If your AI has unique attributes (e.g., explainability, data security, or domain-specific capabilities), make sure to articulate those during deeper conversations.</dd>

      <dt>Thought Leadership</dt>
      <dd>Writing about AI in your blog or whitepapers can help establish credibility, especially if you’re solving complex problems in innovative ways.</dd>

      <dt>Investor Relations</dt>
      <dd>Investors are always keen to hear about cutting-edge technology, provided it’s backed by substance.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>For your everyday marketing, however, keep the focus on the end user and what the technology enables.</p>

    <h2 id="final-thoughts" class="pt-6">Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>AI is undoubtedly transforming industries, but in many ways, it’s becoming table stakesa foundational capability rather than a differentiator. The real challenge is not just building AI into your app but communicating its value in a way that resonates with your audience.</p>

    <p>So the next time you’re tempted to slap “AI-powered” on your product page, pause and ask: what’s the real story here? What’s the unique value we’re delivering? That’s the message that will cut through the noise.</p>

    <p>What do you think? Are we ready to move past the “AI-powered” era in marketing? I know I am.</p>
