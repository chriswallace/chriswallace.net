  <h3>The need</h3>

  <p>Add a new type of product to Candy's marketplace that introduces paired physical-digital products with future plans to allow sales of those collectibles with or without the physical collectible.</p>

  <h3>The issues</h3>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-4">
    <li>No shipping address in the current checkout process (it was all digital delivery)</li>
    <li>How will users know a product includes a paired physical collectible?</li>
    <li>Future state: How will buyers on secondary markets identify collectibles where the physical was claimed by a previous owner?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The solution(s)</h3>

  <p>To address these concerns, I first designed two icons representing a Physical-Digital product type. The first was an icon where the physical edition is still claimable by a future owner of the digital edition. The second was an icon where that physical has already been claimed. These icons were added as badges to our Drop pages. I also proposed adding text to the product imagery to identify a product with digital/physical available and one with just the digital. Because it's a new type of product, I wanted to ensure users fully understood what they are purchasing. And to further drive the point home, I added a banner to the Edition Details pages that explicitly tells you when the edition's physical collectible has been claimed.</p>
  
  <p>I then wireframed multiple checkout flows that allowed users to purchase the product from a primary sale, claim the physical version of the product later, and finally a unified flow where users would claim the physical at checkout, as this would be our first iteration to avoid over-engineering solutions during our beta testing. I collaborated with product management to design and adjust these flows and ensure they encapsulated both technical and partnership requirements.</p>

  <p>From there, I finalized the prototype, shared it with the engineering team and handed it off to our front-end engineer to begin implementing the changes.</p>
