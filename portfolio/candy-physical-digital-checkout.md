  <p class="fade-in-element">Candy Digital sought to expand beyond purely digital collectibles by experimenting with a new hybrid offering: products that paired digital collectibles with physical merchandise. This represented an exciting opportunity to bridge the digital and physical collecting experience, but also introduced new complexity to our marketplace.</p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">The challenge was multifaceted: we needed to seamlessly integrate shipping workflows into our digital-first platform, clearly communicate the dual nature of these items to users, and develop a system to track and display when physical items had been claimedâ€”particularly important for secondary market sales. As the product designer for this initiative, I was responsible for creating an experience that would feel natural to our existing users while accommodating these new requirements.</p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">I developed a comprehensive design solution that introduced new visual language across the platform. This included creating distinctive icons and badges to indicate physical item availability, implementing clear messaging at key decision points, and designing an intuitive checkout flow that incorporated shipping details without disrupting our streamlined purchase experience. Throughout the process, I worked closely with product management to ensure the design met both technical constraints and partnership requirements.</p>
  
  <p class="fade-in-element">The resulting system successfully launched as a pilot program, establishing a foundation for Candy to test and expand into hybrid physical-digital offerings. Users could confidently navigate the purchase and claiming process, while secondary market participants could easily identify whether physical items were still available. The design system proved scalable and has since supported multiple physical-digital product launches.</p>
