  <p class="fade-in-element">Having extensively used various cryptocurrency wallets, I noticed a gap in the market for an iOS-native wallet that could combine robust security with engaging social features, particularly around digital collectibles.</p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">My goal was to create a user-friendly crypto wallet that would not only secure users' digital assets but also make the experience of managing and discovering digital collectibles more enjoyable and intuitive.</p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">I approached this challenge by first focusing on the fundamental security architecture, implementing critical measures to protect users' assets and secret keys. I designed comprehensive onboarding flows that educate users about key security practices. To enhance the social aspect, I developed a digital collectible activity feed and created an organized Collectibles section that automatically categorizes NFTs by collection, making portfolio management more intuitive.</p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">The final design successfully balances security with usability, featuring an engaging social feed that keeps users informed about their digital collectibles, an organized portfolio view, and seamless token swapping capabilities. Through multiple iterations and prototyping in Figma, I validated these features with potential users, ensuring the interface meets both security requirements and user expectations.</p>
