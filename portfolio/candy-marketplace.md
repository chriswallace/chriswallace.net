  <p>I undertook a comprehensive redesign of Candy's Marketplace, focusing on several key areas: the homepage, drops page, individual product drop page, product detail pages, and the overall marketplace section. The primary objective was to enhance the appeal of the products, simplify user understanding, and establish consistent UX patterns across both drops and secondary listings for purchases.</p>

  <p>The new homepage was designed with an emphasis on educating users about Candy's products and digital collectibles, highlighting their value to collectors. This educational approach helps provide context around our products, offering users deeper insights into the brands and the utility they can expect to receive.</p>

  <p>For the drop and product detail pages, I introduced a media slider that allows users to swipe through images and videos, showcasing each piece of media as intended. Additionally, I designed new feature areas that provide detailed information about the utility purchasers can expect, such as available physical rewards/claims and exclusive comic readers for DC Comics, among other examples.</p>

  <p>Finally, I designed a series of components in Figma that were integrated into a new design system, which I have been building concurrently as I work through various parts of the Candy app. This design system ensures a cohesive and consistent user experience across the entire platform.</p>
