  <p class="fade-in-element">As the sole product designer at Candy Digital, I spearheaded the design of a highly-requested feature: enabling users to withdraw digital collectibles to their self-custodied wallets. This feature empowers users with full control over their NFTs, allowing them to transfer and sell through various decentralized marketplaces. My role involved designing the user flow for both withdrawals and deposits, seamlessly integrating these processes into the existing My Collection section of Candy.io.</p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">To achieve this, I delved into the technical intricacies of web3 wallets and blockchain technology, focusing on transaction authorization, wallet connectivity, and user security on Candy.io. Leveraging my expertise with WalletConnect and Web3 Wallet, I crafted a streamlined user experience. Users can effortlessly select collectibles, connect their wallet, and submit withdrawal requests. These requests are then reviewed by our fraud and risk team before being executed on the blockchain.</p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">Designing the deposit process presented additional challenges, as it requires users to sign transactions to transfer collectibles back to Candy.io. I prioritized simplicity and user education, ensuring users understand the potential feature limitations when moving collectibles to self-custodied wallets.</p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">Post-development, I coordinated a beta testing phase with a select group of users utilizing Metamask as the initial supported wallet. The feedback from these successful transactions informed the subsequent rollout to all users.</p>
