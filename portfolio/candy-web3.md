    Users across the Candy Digital platform were increasingly seeking greater autonomy over their digital collectibles. The ability to transfer NFTs to self-custodied wallets had become a crucial feature request, as collectors wanted to participate in the broader NFT ecosystem and trade on various decentralized marketplaces.
  </p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">
    As the sole product designer, I took on the challenge of creating a seamless bidirectional transfer system that would integrate naturally with our existing My Collection section. The solution needed to balance sophisticated blockchain interactions with an intuitive user experience, while maintaining the platform's security standards.
  </p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">
    The implementation process involved several key phases:
  </p>

  <ul class="fade-in-element mt-0 pl-4 list-disc">
    <li>Deep technical research into web3 wallet integration, particularly WalletConnect and Web3 Wallet implementations</li>
    <li>Development of an intuitive bulk-selection interface for managing multiple collectibles</li>
    <li>Creation of clear withdrawal flows incorporating wallet connectivity and transaction authorization</li>
    <li>Implementation of educational elements to help users understand self-custody implications</li>
    <li>Design of a deposit workflow guiding users through transaction signing</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fade-in-element">
    Following a targeted beta testing phase with Metamask users, the feature launched successfully platform-wide. The implementation earned positive feedback for its straightforward approach to complex blockchain interactions, while maintaining security through our fraud and risk team's oversight. This addition transformed how users interact with their digital assets, enabling them to freely participate in the broader NFT ecosystem while retaining the option to return to institutional custody.
