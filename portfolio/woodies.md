    In 2021, I co-founded a decentralized creative studio with the vision of pioneering innovative, community-driven entertainment IP. Our flagship project, Woodies, became a cornerstone of this mission. Woodies is a collection of 10,000 generative avatars, each representing a unique character, that served as the foundation for a robust storytelling universe and groundbreaking technological advancements in Web3.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in-element">
    Woodies is more than a collection of digital avatars—it's a celebration of creativity and environmental storytelling. At the heart of the Woodies universe is Arden, a tree spirit brought to life by the magic of Merkle, the mother tree. Arden's story unfolds in an animated short film that depicts his quest to save his decimated forest and rescue its kidnapped inhabitants.

  <p class="fade-in-element">
    The animated short film was brought to life through a unique collaboration between our team of artists and Woodblock, a German animation studio. We worked together to craft a narrative suitable for a 3-minute silent short. This required designing and modeling all the 3D characters including Arden's "forest friends" and our four core characters who made appereances. To top it all off, we worked with Gareth Coker, composer of the Ori video game series, to score the film.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in-element">
    The animated short became a centerpiece of the project, connecting the avatars to a larger mythos and giving our community a reason to invest emotionally, not just financially.

    As project lead, I formed our first key project, built a core team, led development of the Woodies brand, narrative, and art style, and led the team to build our first project: Woodies Generative Characters. The first goal was to create a world and lore that resonated deeply with our community. We had a set of artists, a lead storyteller, blockchain and web engineers, and a larger group providing feedback and ideas along the way.

    Woodies was also a technological first. In addition to the initial 10,000 generative 2D avatars, we released a 3D collection of metaverse-ready avatars—the first of its kind at the time. These 3D assets empowered owners to bring their Woodies to life in virtual environments, from gaming platforms to metaverse worlds, further expanding the project's reach and utility.
  </p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">
    The first 3D release enabled all Woodies holders to play with their new avatars in <a href="https://decentraland.org">Decentraland</a>, a blockchain-powered metaverse where players can buy their own plots of land and build worlds together.

  <p class="fade-in-element">
    After that, we worked with <a href="https://niftyisland.com">Nifty Island</a> to bring all 9,739 models into their metaverse platform, where players get an island and can build a variety of structures, program games, and visit other islands to earn in-game currency.

    Soon following the release of the Woodies Generative Characters collection, we collaborated with nearly a dozen artists from UltraDAO and others in the Web3 space to create a series of digital trading cards called Legends of Wondermist. This collection included pieces from some of the top artists in the world, including Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park, DesLucrece,  Waxbones, Amrit Pal Singh, and Diela Maharanie.

    Beyond its creative and technological achievements, Woodies was committed to giving back. As part of our roadmap, we made a significant donation to Trees for the Future, a nonprofit dedicated to sustainable reforestation efforts. This contribution planted tens of thousands of trees, aligning the project's ethos with real-world environmental impact.
  </p>

  <p class="fade-in-element">
    Woodies demonstrated how storytelling, technology, and community can come together to create something truly innovative. For me, this project was a career highlight—not just for its professional success but for its ability to inspire, connect, and make a tangible difference in the world.
