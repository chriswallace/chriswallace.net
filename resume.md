          <p>Led all product design efforts across the company. I redesigned our website and marketplace to learn about digital collectibles and gain access to better tools for buying and selling. I also designed net new features like withdrawing collectibles and buying paired physical and digital items. I also worked more holistically, taking the initiative to create a design system to make work easier and faster for our design and engineering teams. One of my favorite projects was designing and coding the app for an interactive comic book reader for digital DC Comics complete with x-ray, pop-up factoids, and panel reading modes.</p>

          <p>I started UltraDAO Studios to bring together artists, engineers, and creators to make new IP through impeccable storytelling and engaging artistry. The result was Woodies, a collection of digital avatars on the Ethereum blockchain that sold out in less than 30 minutes.

We later released an acclaimed animated short along with the first large-scale 3D avatars for metaverse platforms like Decentraland and Nifty Island.</p>
