#### Senior E-Commerce Web Designer at Network Solutions / _2006-2007_ / _Belleville, IL_

I designed and wrote front-end code for e-commerce storefronts for small businesses (it was like the first Shopify). Much of my time was spent working directly with clients, managing their projects to a strict two- or four-week timeline and creating themes to their specifications.

#### Webmaster at St. Louis Christian College / _2005-2006_ / _St. Louis, MO_

As web content owner, I was responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of our website and all visual communications. I was the first designer and led the production of a quarterly full-color newsletter, banner and magazine ads, posters, brochures, as well as all our web graphics and applications. In my tenure, the school experienced 60% growth and by the next school year, the campus was filled to capacity with a total growth nearing 200%.

## Recent Work

Here are a few links to projects I’ve worked on in a creative direction and production design capacity. The links referenced fore each are live, up-to-date, and entirely designed by me and my team.

#### [Woodies: Origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=encMCWoBc3o) / _Executive Creative Director_

Over the course of approximately six months, I hired and directed an international media production company in the creation of an animated short film with a budget of approximately $500,000. The result is a Hollywood-caliber short film that immerses fans in the Woodies universe.

#### [California DMV Website Redesign](https://dmv.ca.gov) / _Executive Creative Director_

In early 2020, I worked on the largest project in our agency’s history, completing a massive redesign of the California DMV website. I hired and oversaw the design work for the team who executed on this work. The redesign was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews from the public and and DMV team.

#### [StoryCorps Google Doodle](https://storycorps.org/google-doodle) / _Lead Designer_

In 2019, our client, StoryCorps, asked for help putting together a landing page that would be linked to a new Google Doodle for Veteran’s Day. I worked directly with our stakeholder to design this page and ultimately helped drive massive awareness of StoryCorp and their mission to archive America’s oral history through voice recordings.

#### [Google Site Kit](https://sitekit.withgoogle.com) / _Executive Creative Director_

In 2019, we worked with Google to launch a plugin for WordPress site owners that unifies their Google suite of products in one place. This new product, dubbed Site Kit by Google, would become the official Google WordPress plugin and be download by hundreds of thousands of website owners in just a few short months. I worked with our lead designer to produce a design language that was both uniquely Google but also fitting for the WordPress admin, a balance that was quite difficult to strike.

#### 10up Brand & Recruiting Videos / _Executive Producer_

[Brand Video](https://vimeo.com/284765957)
[Recruiting Video](https://vimeo.com/284768433)

In 2018, I pitched the idea of creating two videos for 10up: one for our potential clients and a second for potential employees to meet and learn more about us. Using our annual company meetup in Jackson Hole, Wyoming as the backdrop, we flew a video crew out for a few days to capture footage and interview clients and team members. I functioned both as an Executive Producer and Creative Director for the project.

#### [GoDaddy Go Theme](https://www.godaddy.com/wordpress-themes) / _Executive Creative Director_

In 2019, I worked with two senior designers on a project for returning client, GoDaddy. With thousands of customers, GoDaddy needed our help architecting a system with computational design powering an endless array of themes. If you click through the link above, you’ll see what appears to be hundreds of different website templates but it’s all powered by the Go WordPress theme.

Having contributed directly to the exact same type of project for GoDaddy many years earlier, my role in this was to advise both the client and our internal designers on how to be successful in crafting this theme framework. I critiqued design progress every week and offered insight that helped guide them along the way. I also worked directly with the engineering team to ensure they understood the design direction and the ideal way to implement our work.

This new theme has powered a massive spike in user signups and WordPress users for GoDaddy and was praised by the CEO during an earnings report.
