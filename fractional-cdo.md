<h2 class="fade-in-element">Why Invest in Design Leadership?</h2>

<dl class="fade-in-element">
  <dt>Build Teams That Build Great Things</dt>
  <dd>Great design doesn't happen in isolation. It emerges from teams that trust each other, challenge each other, and share a commitment to exceptional craft. Strategic leadership creates the conditions where this kind of collaboration thrives.</dd>

  <dt>Mentorship as a Multiplier</dt>
  <dd>The impact of a great design leader isn't just their individual output—it's how they elevate everyone around them. Through mentorship and coaching, one leader can exponentially increase the capabilities of an entire team.</dd>

  <dt>Connect People and Ideas</dt>
  <dd>The best design leaders are connectors. They bring together the right people, surface the right insights, and create opportunities for breakthrough thinking. This network effect often leads to the most innovative solutions.</dd>

  <dt>Craft as a Competitive Advantage</dt>
  <dd>In a world of increasing automation and AI assistance, the human judgment around craft, taste, and appropriateness becomes more valuable, not less. Teams with high craft standards create products that stand out in the market.</dd>
