    "description": "“Take Wing” is a generative art collection depicting the hope, optimism, and thrilling excitement of a person taking off, gaining traction, and soaring to new heights and off into the great unknown.  \n\nThe algorithm behind the piece stems from an attempt to go back to art fundamentals and codify composition rules and painterly techniques into a generative form - taking into account focal points, contrast, eye movement, and color theory while still giving the algorithm freedom to explore random color palettes, random flow field movement, random brush strokes, and many other degrees of freedom.\n\nThe collection is made in pure code with p5.js and a few GLSL fragment shaders.\n\nThe piece has been created to be exhibited at \"In Touch\" with VerticalCryptoArt in Berlin in September 2022, curated by Anika Meier.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo get a (somewhat) high-resolution output, open the live view of your token, and then edit the URL adding &h=5400 at the end of it.  5400 is the tallest you can go, but you can also put a smaller number if you desire.  Be aware that this will only work on a machine with a very beefy GPU, and even then may take a bit, so please be patient!",
